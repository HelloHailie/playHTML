    I haven't been worried to see the dentist since I was younger.But over the last year, I got to know why people are worried to see the dentist.The first dental care was simply to fill the lower two teeth with resin filling when I felt like they hurt.One day about two months after the first dental care, while I was brushing my teeth, I chewed something weird !That was a tiny little resin tooth filling which was filled two months ago.I had to go to the dentist to be treated again and there was no extra charge for that because it has after-sales service for 1 year.But that was just a beginning. After that, I've gone there four times more.I promised myself not to go to THE dentist again.
